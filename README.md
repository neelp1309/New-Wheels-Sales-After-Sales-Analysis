# 📊 New-Wheels Sales & After-Sales Analysis (SQL Project)

## 🚗 Business Context

Many people around the world aspire to own a vehicle. While new vehicles are desirable, pre-owned vehicles are becoming increasingly popular due to their affordability. However, concerns about the quality of after-sales service remain.

**New-Wheels**, a vehicle resale company, aims to bridge this gap by offering an end-to-end solution through its app—right from listing a vehicle to delivering it to the customer and collecting after-sales feedback. However, in the past year, sales have declined due to poor customer feedback and low ratings.

## 🎯 Objective

The CEO of New-Wheels needs a **quarterly report** that includes key business metrics and insights to:

- Assess the company's performance
- Identify customer sentiment
- Address critical bottlenecks in sales and service
- Take corrective measures based on data

As a data analyst, I imported and analyzed transactional data to answer leadership-level business questions and build a comprehensive report.
